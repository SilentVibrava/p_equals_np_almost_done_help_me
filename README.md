I am sick and tired of hiding this algorithm. Ever since I imagined this algorithm in my head weird things have happened to me in 2016 and 2017. I kept it to myself because I was greedy. I wanted to money and fame. But I've changed my mind. Children and adults are dying in hospitals due to lack of effective medicine. I relinquish what I have of this algorithm so far to the world so we can work together to end the tyranny of expensive drugs, and to inspire hope and change of the human race. I refuse to do it the way of the Clay Mathematics Institute. Let's do this everyone. Open source community, let's do this!
